## Code Challenge, GitHub Interview

I hope this repository helps someone else to get a job at GitHub. The code challenge is the same for all recent candidates (as of 2020-2022 according to multiple developers I asked), only in different programming languages (Ruby, JavaScript, Go).

## Interview Process

1. Connect with a GitHub recruiter on LinkedIn
2. Express interest in a job, for example, [this one](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3074872733/) ([mirror](JOB_DESCRIPTION.md))
3. Talent Acquisition send you this link: https://interviews.githubapp.com
4. You solve [the code challenge described here](CODE_CHALLENGE.md) in 2 hours or less
5. You submit a pull-request like this → [PULL_REQUEST.md](PULL_REQUEST.md)
6. GitHub Actions gives a “Good” or “Not Good” result to the recruiter
7. Recruiter asks for your time availability for the technical interviews
8. Talent Coordinator schedules 4 interviews each lasting 50 minutes
  - Technical Interview 1 - Coding Exercise. Planning and Communication, Coding, Architecture
  - Technical Interview 2 - Code Review Exercise. Best Practices, CS Fundamentals, Problem Solving, Communication
  - Behavioral & Competency 1 - Engineering Culture, Inclusive Behaviors and Collaboration.
  - Behavioral & Competency 2 - Technical Aptitude and Communication
9. If you pass, you get an offer, a chance to negotiate, start a background check, and join in approximately 3-4 weeks.

## My Results

Although I passed the Talent Acquision screener, the code challenge with the code in this repository, and even scheduled the technical interviews, GitHub cancelled them because they *“[…] decided to pause hiring for this role at the time.”*. [Read the whole email here](INTERVIEW_RESULT.md).

I hope you, reader, have better luck than me.
