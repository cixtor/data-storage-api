## About the job

Software Engineer at GitHub Where the world builds software.

Over 75 million developers globally build, ship, and maintain their software on GitHub - the largest and most advanced development platform in the world. We need you to help build GitHub as the home for all developers.

We expect you to have strong problem-solving skills, willingness to learn new technologies, effective communication skills,and a commitment to make everyone on your team feel included.
